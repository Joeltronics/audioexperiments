# Zero-Delay Feedback Filters

This is very old code, from roughly 2015-2017. It was originally Python 2, then updated to Python 3, and later imported here.
I've cleaned it up quite a bit, but there are still some ugly parts.

The goal here is precise calculation, not speed.
This also currently only models ideal models of circuits, not the component tolerances & mismatches that can cause analog character.
