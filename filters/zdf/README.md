# Zero-Delay Filters

This is very old code, from roughly 2015-2017. It was originally Python 2, then updated to Python 3, and later imported here.

There's a lot that it doesn't do very well!

# TODO

* Consolidate, reorganize, and de-duplicate onepole.py/multipole.py/filters.py
  * All 1-pole into onepole
  * All multipole into multipole
  * Delete filters.py
* zdf_mystran - remove my other code 
* More integration with rest of framework (e.g. ProcessorBase)
* Partially integrated with solvers, but still need to integrate more, and remove bad usage of legacy stuff
